We are grateful for our team’s achievements and hard work, which resulted in saving many lives, what is also our moto „Because each life matters“. Our factories had been working in 3 shifts, so that all the deadlines would be respected. We also give big gratitude to health workers, who worked 24/7 to stop the virus spread and save lives.',

Sinofarm Ltd.

    title2: 'Why should I wear a mask If I am not infected?',
    text4: `When you wear a mask, you protect others as well as yourself. Masks work best when everyone wears one. A mask is NOT a substitute for social distancing. Masks should still be worn in addition to staying at least 2 metres apart, especially when indoors around people who don’t live in your household. Masks should completely cover the nose and mouth and fit snugly against the sides of face without gaps. Masks should be worn any time you are traveling on a plane, bus, train, or other form of public transportation. People age 3 and older should wear masks in public settings and when around people who don’t live in their household. Wear a mask inside your home if someone you live with is sick with symptoms of COVID-19 or has tested positive for COVID-19. COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets. Respiratory droplets travel into the air when you cough, sneeze, talk, shout, or sing. These droplets can then land in the mouths or noses of people.`,
    text5: `Masks are a simple barrier to help prevent your respiratory droplets from reaching others. Studies show that masks reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth.
          You should wear a mask, even if you do not feel sick. This is because several studies have found that people with COVID-19 who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and those who are not yet showing symptoms (pre-symptomatic) can still spread the virus to other people. Wearing a mask helps protect those around you, in case you are infected but not showing symptoms. 
          It is especially important to wear a mask when you are indoors with people you do not live with and when you are unable to stay at least 2 metres apart since COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another.`,
